//NODE - is a framework to run js on server, also is able to provide everything that 
//we need to build an entertprse level application
//I/O - operations
//db connections
//file manipulations
//creating web servers
//creating http modules
//etc...


//NodeJs - JRE -> whats the difference?

//real time time systems - node js
//100s of connections linkdin - can share information including text, images, videos, etc
//node(live, light weight servers) base systems- points on varios servers to store and serve the information
//majorly it uses flat file structure to save and fetch data
//event loop based high performant single threaded framework

//limitations -
//all the task where calculation is involved

//service oriented architecture
//backend is termed as API or services and responds with data (json) over RESTFul/https channels
//fronted is single page, contains logic to generate UI on the fly with the help of server data

//REST => Representational State Transfer Protocol  /request <-> response
//API => Application Programming Interface

//REST Specifications =>
//Unique End Point = https://google.map.us/state/locations
//http/s => hyper text type protocol and is stateless  / transferring information between client and server side.
//http/s is resonsible for representational information, html5 => hyper text markup language
//stateless - if another link is clicked the new page that is rendered will not know what was in the previous page.
//stateless -  each request is executed independently, without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it,
//stateless app is an application program that does not save client data generated in one session for use in the next session with that client

// when user log in and we fetch the information that is in the cart is called Transferring state of Representational which is stateless into the server and getting back info from the server create the same state.

//one api should do one job well
//User - API -should be able to do CRUD operations

//http methods
//Create - POST
//Update - PUT/PATCH
//Delete - Delete
//GetUser - Get
//GetUserByID - Get/ID


//Request <==> Response (handshake)
