// Flux base architecture - publisher subscriber method
// Redux will implement this architecture
// Object which stores all the states will be termed as - store (one store per app)
// The object which will update the state is - Action - {payload : datatoupdate, type : edit,delete}
// We need callback - reducer to generate new state using - Acions Type and Actions Payload - always returns new state
//       initial states (to be used to combine in reducer), switch cases to handle action type for everynew state
// Action creator - to define the action which will be invoked (like click event handler)
// Dispatcher - a function which makes application work in call back
